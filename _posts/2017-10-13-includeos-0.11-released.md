We've just released [IncludeOS 0.11]. It's been half a year since our last release and we have quite a few features lined up for release.


### Major features:
* LiveUpdate. [Example](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/tree/master/examples/LiveUpdate)
* Solo5 / ukvm support. [Example](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/blob/master/test_ukvm.sh), [Solo5/uvkm blog post](http://www.includeos.org/blog/2017/includeos-on-solo5-and-ukvm.html)
* WebSockets [Example](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/tree/master/examples/websocket)
* Built-in auto configuration of services using config.json. [Example](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/blob/master/examples/websocket/config.json)

### Multiarch / multiplatform:
* 64-bit support, now default. [IncludeOS 64-bit blog post](http://www.includeos.org/blog/2017/includeos-is-now-64bit.html)
* 32-bit chainloader for use with boot tool
* Reorganized for multiple platforms.

### Networking:
* Support TCP options/features; Timestamp & Window Scaling (RFC 7323) and Delayed ACK
* Path MTU Discovery, RFC 1191 (IPv4) and partly RFC 1981 (IPv6). Disabled by default until more thoroughly tested in the wild. See [the unit test for example](https://github.com/hioa-cs/IncludeOS/tree/master/test/net/unit/path_mtu_discovery.cpp)
* Kernel hooks for filter chains. Will enable upcoming firewall / NAT functionality.
* Support for Virtual IPs in Inet and TCP
* Support for partial IP/TCP checksumming
* DNS Client caching.
* Inet Domain Name support.

### Utilities:
* Fixed size version of MemBitmap - allocates and owns storage.
* CMake now supports additional arguments (see #1404)
* CMake option for what CPU features to compile for.
* CRC64 and base64 implementations by @RicoAntonioFelix
* Script to easily [run IncludeOS instances in VMware](http://blog.includeos.org/2017/04/04/running-includeos-unikernels-with-vmware)

### Fixes:
* Time is now the same as the hosts time on all supported cloud vendors and hypervisors.
* Port_util now works correctly.

Extra special thanks to [@RicoAntonioFelix] for innumerable improvements, and to [@dfct] for help with TCP cleanup.
